# Pivotal Greenplum-Spark Connector
The [Pivotal Greenplum-Spark Connector](http://greenplum-spark.docs.pivotal.io/100/index.html) provides high speed, parallel data transfer between Greenplum Database and Apache Spark clusters to support:

- Interactive data analysis
- In-memory analytics processing
- Batch ETL

# Apache Spark
Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

- [docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose)
- [Greenplum-Spark connector](http://greenplum-spark.docs.pivotal.io/100/index.html)
- [Postgres JDBC driver - if you want to write data from Spark into Greenplum ](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-42.1.4.jar)


# Using docker-compose
To create a standalone Greenplum cluster with the following command in the github root directory.
It builds a docker image with Pivotal Greenplum binaries and download some existing images such as Spark master and worker. Initially, it may take some time to download the docker image.
```
    $ runGPDBSpark2-1.sh
    docker_master_1 is up-to-date
    Creating gpdbsne ...
    Creating docker_worker_1 ...
    Creating gpdbsne
    Creating gpdbsne ... done

```
The SparkUI will be running at `http://localhost:8080` with one worker listed.

To access `Greenplum cluster`, exec into a container:
```
    $ docker exec -it gpdbsne bin/bash
    root@master:/usr/spark-2.1.0#
```
## Setup Greenplum with sample tables
Follow this [readme](README_DB.md)

##  Connect to Greenplum and Spark via Greenplum-Spark connector
In this example, we will describe how to configure Greenplum-Spark connector when you run Spark-shell.

1. Make sure you download greenplum-spark_2.11-1.3.0.jar or latest jar from Pivotal Network.

2. Connect to the Spark master docker image
```
$ docker exec -it gpdbsne bin/bash /bin/bash
```
3. Run the command to start a spark shell that loads Greenplum-Spark connector. This section assumes you have downloaded latest greenplum-spark.jar under the github repo with subfolder `scripts`.  The root directory is mounted by the docker images under /code directory.  You can also use scripts such as `scripts/download_postgresql.sh` to download binaries.

Also, we included Postgresql (optional), in order to write data from Spark into Greenplum. Greenplum-Spark connector will support write features in future release and support parallel data transfer that performs significantly better than JDBC driver.
```

4. Verify Greenplum-Spark driver is successfully loaded by Spark Shell
You can follow the example below to verify the Greenplum-Spark driver. The scala repl confirms the driver is accessible by returning `res0` result.
```
scala> Class.forName("io.pivotal.greenplum.spark.GreenplumRelationProvider")
res0: Class[_] = class io.pivotal.greenplum.spark.GreenplumRelationProvider
```

Verify JDBC driver is successfully loaded by Spark Shell
You can follow the example below to verify the JDBC driver. The scala repl confirms the driver is accessible by returning `res1` result.
```
scala> Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver")
res1: Class[_] = class org.postgresql.Driver
```

## Read data from Greenplum into Spark
In this section, we will read data from Greenplum into Spark. It assumes the database and table are already created. See [how to setup GPDB DB with script](README_DB.md)

1. By default, you can run the command below to retrieve data from Greenplum with a single data partition in Spark cluster. In order to paste the command, you need to type `:paste` in the scala environment and paste the code below, followed by `Ctrl-D`
```
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)
// that gives an one-partition Dataset
val dataFrame = spark.read.format("io.pivotal.greenplum.spark.GreenplumRelationProvider")
.option("dbtable", "basictable")
.option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://docker_gpdb_1/basic_db")
.option("user", "gpadmin")
.option("password", "pivotal")
.option("driver", "org.postgresql.Driver")
.option("partitionColumn", "id")
.load()

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

```
2. You can verify the Spark DataFrame by running these commands `dataFrame.printSchema` and `dataFrame.show()`
```
scala> dataFrame.printSchema
root
 |-- id: integer (nullable = false)
 |-- value: string (nullable = true)
scala> dataFrame.show()
+---+--------+
| id|   value|
+---+--------+
|  1|   Alice|
|  3| Charlie|
|  5|     Jim|
|  7|    Jack|
|  9|     Zim|
| 15|     Jim|
| 11|     Bob|
| 13|     Eve|
| 17|Victoria|
| 25|Victoria|
| 27|   Alice|

| 19|   Alice|
| 21| Charlie|
| 23|     Jim|
| 33|     Jim|
| 35|     Eve|
| 43|Victoria|
| 45|   Alice|
+---+--------+
only showing top 20 rows
scala> dataFrame.filter(dataFrame("id") > 40).show()
+---+--------+
| id|   value|
+---+--------+
| 41|     Jim|
| 43|    Jack|
| 45|     Zim|
| 47|   Alice|
| 49| Charlie|
| 51|     Jim|
| 53|    Jack|
| 55|     Bob|
| 57|     Eve|
| 59|    John|
| 61|Victoria|
| 63|     Zim|
| 65|     Bob|
| 67|     Eve|
| 69|    John|
| 71|Victoria|
| 73|     Bob|
| 75|   Alice|
| 77| Charlie|
| 79|     Jim|
+---+--------+
only showing top 20 rows

scala> dataFrame.explain
== Physical Plan ==
*Scan GreenplumRelation(StructType(StructField(id,IntegerType,false), StructField(value,StringType,true)),[Lio.pivotal.greenplum.spark.GreenplumPartition;@738ed8f5,io.pivotal.greenplum.spark.GreenplumOptions@1cfb7450) [id#0,value#1]
```

3. You create a temporary table to cache the results from Greenplum and using option to speed your in-memory processing in Spark cluster.  [Global temporary view](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) is tied to a system preserved database global_temp, and we must use the qualified name to refer it, e.g. SELECT * FROM global_temp.view1. Meanwhile, Temporary views in Spark SQL are session-scoped and will disappear if the session that creates it terminates.
```
scala>
// Register the DataFrame as a global temporary view
dataFrame.createGlobalTempView("tempdataFrame")

// Global temporary view is tied to a system preserved database `global_temp`
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM global_temp.tempdataFrame").show()
```


## How to write data from Spark DataFrame into Greenplum
In this section, you can write data from Spark DataFrame into Greenplum table. by using JDBC driver. Please note: Greenplum - Spark connector does NOT yet support data transfer from Spark into Greenplum.

Pre-requisites:
1. Run the script under scripts/download_postgresql.sh to download postgresql-42.1.4.jar

2. Make sure your spark shell is loaded the Postgresql jar.
```
root@master:/usr/spark-2.1.0#GSC_JAR=$(ls /code/scripts/greenplum-spark_2.11-*.jar)
root@master:/usr/spark-2.1.0#POSTGRES_JAR=$(ls /code/scripts/postgresql-*.jar)
root@master:/usr/spark-2.1.0#spark-shell --jars "${GSC_JAR},${POSTGRES_JAR}" --driver-class-path ${POSTGRES_JAR}

scala>
```


3. Determine the number of records in the "basictable" table by using psql command.  
```
$ docker exec -it docker_gpdb_1 /bin/bash
[root@d632f535db87 data]# psql -h localhost -U gpadmin -d basic_db -c "select count(*) from basictable"

 count
-------
18432
(1 row)
```
2. Configure JDBC URL and connection Properties and use DataFrame write operation to write data from Spark into Greenplum. You can use different write mode
```
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

val jdbcUrl = s"jdbc:postgresql://docker_gpdb_1/basic_db?user=gpadmin&password=pivotal"
val connectionProperties = new java.util.Properties()
dataFrame.write.mode("Append") .jdbc( url = jdbcUrl, table = "basictable", connectionProperties = connectionProperties)

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

```
3. Verify the write operation is successful by exec into GPDB container and run psql command-line. The total number records in the Greenplum table must be 2x of the original data.
```
$ docker exec -it docker_gpdb_1 /bin/bash
[root@d632f535db87 data]# psql -h localhost -U gpadmin -d basic_db -c "select count(*) from basictable" -w pivotal
psql: warning: extra command-line argument "pivotal" ignored
 count
-------
`18432`
(1 row)
```

4. Next, you can write DataFrame data into an new Greenplum table via `append` mode.
```
scala>dataFrame.write.mode("Append") .jdbc( url = jdbcUrl, table = "NEWTable", connectionProperties = connectionProperties)
```

5. Run psql commands to verify the new table with new records.
```
[root@d632f535db87 scripts]# psql -h localhost -U gpadmin -d basic_db -c "\dt"
List of relations
Schema |            Name             | Type  |  Owner
--------+-----------------------------+-------+---------
public | basictable                  | table | gpadmin
public | newtable                    | table | gpadmin
public | spark_7ac1947b17a17725_0_41 | table | gpadmin
public | spark_7ac1947b17a17725_0_42 | table | gpadmin
(4 rows)

[root@d632f535db87 data]# psql -h localhost -U gpadmin -d basic_db -c "select count(*) from newtable" -w pivotal
psql: warning: extra command-line argument "pivotal" ignored
 count
-------
18432
(1 row)
```

## Conclusions
Greenplum-Spark connector uses Greenplum gpfdist protocol to parallelize data transfer between Greenplum and Spark clusters. Therefore, this connector provides better read throughput, compared to typical JDBC driver.
